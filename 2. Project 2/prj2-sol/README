Implemetation - (as clarified by the professor)

 	The URLs are mapped base on SHORTNER_BASE provided while adding the URL.

	For example, 	
	
		Command 1 - ./index.js  cs544.io mongodb://localhost:27017/urls add http://a.b.c/xx.html	- gives the shortened URL http://cs544.io/hxgy25
		Command 2 - ./index.js  cs000.io mongodb://localhost:27017/urls add http://a.b.c/xx.html	- gives the shortened URL http://cs000.io/reru5m though the long URL is same, SHORTNER_BASE is different

		This is applied to every other operation.

		For query - ./index.js  cs000.io mongodb://localhost:27017/urls query http://cs000.io/reru5m	- increases the count for URL mapped for cs000.io and not for cs544.io

		For count - ./index.js  cs000.io mongodb://localhost:27017/urls count http://a.b.c/xx.html	- this will return 1, as we have queried short URL of cs000.io
   			    ./index.js  cs544.io mongodb://localhost:27017/urls count http://a.b.c/xx.html	- this will retrun 0, as we have not queried short URL of cs544.io

		Same applied for deactivation as well, if we provide long URL for deactivation command, it will deactivate the short URL based on the SHORTNER_BASE provided with the command.


	While, for clear operation, irrespective of the SHORTNER_BASE, the DB will be cleared.
